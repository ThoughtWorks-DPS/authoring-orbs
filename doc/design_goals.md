Think about what kind of Orb you want to create.   

| Specific Tool or Process | Collection | Build or Domain Workflows |
|--------------------------|------------|---------------------------|
| One or more commands that implement specific patterns or best-practice uses of a specific tool or process. For tools, this should include installation. | A collection of commands, executors, or jobs that are useful across many types of pipelines and create a better user experience when bundled together. | Complete language or resource specific workflows, including non or cross-functional requirements |
